PHP Markov_ebooks twitter client
v0.2

This PHP script is designed to take the recent tweets from a particular twitter handle, run them through a markov chain generator, and regugitate them as a twitter bot, akin to horse_ebooks. 

Right now all it does is squirt prospective _ebooks tweets onto STDOUT when run on the command line. Of course, I will be adding twitter oauth nonsense at a later date so this may actually tweet.

configuration options are currently available in the first two lines of main.php

base_tweetist = the twitter account to use as a seed for your bot
tweet_length = number of characters for the tweet (useful if you want to include hash tags)
randomness = not a very useful variable, only setting 3 or 4 produces a legible-yet random output

the core functionality (grabbing tweets, the markov chain) comes from http://f6design.com/journal/2010/10/07/display-recent-twitter-tweets-using-php/ and http://www.decontextualize.com/teaching/ppp/php-classes-web-templates/ 

TODO:

*Twitter oauth integration (so this can tweet)
*crontab/whatever instructions (so this can tweet automatically)
*a better markov chain function (current always begins with first word in the seed string)
